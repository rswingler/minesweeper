An implementation of minesweeper using React Hooks and Typescript.

- To try the game, run `yarn install` then `yarn start`

- Features:
    - Empty areas are shown recursively when clicked
    - Clue numbers are shown and are color-coded
    - Clicking a mine ends the game: "Game Over!"
    - Clicking all non-mine tiles wins the game: "You Win!"
    - All mines are shown when the game is lost
    - Mine count and placement are randomized, set to easy difficulty
